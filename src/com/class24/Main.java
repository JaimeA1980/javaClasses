//1. Complete the Dog.java class:
//
//Create following class variables. 
//dogName
//dogWeight   
//static dogBreed=Mutt;
//For all methods and variables use proper naming convention. 
//
//
//Write two constructors:
//* The main constructor(include all the variables as parameter)
//* A secondary constructor that takes in only Name and Weight 
//2. Create a display method to print the values of class variable in Dog class. 
//
//2. In Main class Create a Dog object using both Constructors.and they call display method with each object 
//
//Output:
//1.The main constructor(with all parameters) 
//Expected console output: 
//Tarzan Mutt 50.0
//
//2.secondary constructor that takes in only Name and Weight (Breed defaults to "Mutt")
//Expected console output
//Tarzan Mutt 50.0
